// react is a LIBRARY of js(javascript)
// used to make frontend that is the ui interface
// it is not a programming language

// #features of react.js
// 1.single page application
// 2.component based application

// //multi page application-HTML and CSS
// if a website has multiple pages , it is called multipage(HTML AND CSS)
// it takes time to load the pages that reduces its speed
// html and css made websites are slower as compared to react.js

// //single page application-react.js
// if we make same website with react js, there will only be a single page application
// the data gets replaced with the new data wanted.thus, not loading of pages and pages does not speed of website.
// it is generally more faster compared to html and css made website.


//component based application-react.js
// we cannot divide the features/components(nav bar,body,header,footer) of a html and css code.

// but we can divide the components of a react file into many parts that increases the accuracy and readibility of file.

//// installation of react:: we require a node.js(kinda backend)


// JS + HTML = JSX
